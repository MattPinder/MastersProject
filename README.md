NCBI PGAP seems to be only for those ready to submit a genome - unsuitable

Downloaded myRAST to my laptop, will compare results with those obtained
previously (no version number given in Oskar's documentation, though he
appears to have used the web-based version).

Pathway Tools would not have the full range of pathway/genome databases if
installed on my computer, so may attempt on Albiorix at a later date.

Uploaded fasta to RAST web service using default settings, for comparison
with results obtained by Oskar.

Attempting to get GitHub to work - succeeded in syncing local git repository
with online GitHub account.

Downloaded Excel spreadsheet of RAST results and compared with Oskar's most
recent .gbk file; contrary to his observations, a small proportion of the
genes predicted by RAST had names. These names sometimes conflicted with the
names found by Oskar, however, despite consistent locations and functions.
