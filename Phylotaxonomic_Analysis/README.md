# Phylotaxonomic analysis
Complete versions of the subsampled phylogenetic trees present in the report.  
Unless otherwise noted, sequences from NCBI's ftp site were downloaded in
February 2017 using the [NCBI Downloader script] (https://github.com/MattPinder/MastersProject/tree/master/Scripts).

## Rhodobacteraceae.tree.nwk

* Tree showing the position of samples pb_359_2, pb_359_3, pb_359_6 and pb_359_7 within
the family Rhodobacteraceae (order Rhodobacterales).
* Two members of the genus *Hyphomonas* (family Hyphomonadaceae, order Rhodobacterales) act as the outgroup.
* Note - The sequence from *Roseovarius mucosus* is currently listed as 'suppressed' on NCBI;
this wasn't the case in previous versions of the tree, and due to its proximity to
pb_359_2 it was downloaded manually and has still been included in the analysis.

## Sphingomonadales.tree.nwk

* Tree showing the position of sample pb_359_4 within the order Sphingomonadales (class Alphaproteobacteria).
* Two members of the genus *Brucella* (order Rhizobiales, class Alphaproteobacteria) act as the outgroup.

## Alteromonadales.tree.nwk

* Tree showing the position of sample pb_359_5 within the order Alteromonadales (class Gammaproteobacteria).
* Two members of the genus *Escherichia* (order Enterobacterales, class Gammaproteobacteria) act as the outgroup.

## Flavobacteriaceae.tree.nwk

* Tree showing the position of sample pb_359_8 within the family Flavobacteriaceae (order Flavobacteriales).
* Two members of the family Crocinitomicaceae (genera Crocinitomix and Fluviicola; order Flavobacteriales) act as the outgroup.
